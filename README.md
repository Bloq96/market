# market

This project was created with the objective of developing a simple sales and inventory management system in a marketing environment. It was developed using a test-driven design methodology.

The basic structure of the market system will be divided into two parts, both controlled by a user, representing the market owner, manager or seller:

The first part is the storage. This part will include four features, which are adding, removing, updating the quantity and searching for a product in stock.

The second part is that of sales. This part will also include four basic features: creating a cart, adding and removing products from the cart, and closing the cart.
